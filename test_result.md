# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the broiler farm management system frontend interface. All features are working correctly: Batch Identification Form, 4-Phase Feed Tracking, Enhanced Costs, Removal Batches, Performance Dashboard, Results Display, and Batch History. The tabbed interface provides a smooth user experience, and all calculations are accurate. The only minor issue found is that client-side validation for age range (35-60 days) in removal batches is not enforced in the UI, though the backend validation works correctly. The handler performance dashboard with ranking and visual progress bars works excellently, and the cost breakdown visualization is clear and accurate."

    message: "Completed testing of the admin features and PDF export functionality. Found several issues: 1) The handler performance endpoint (/api/handlers/performance) is returning 404 Not Found, 2) The handler names endpoint (/api/handlers/names) is returning 404 Not Found, 3) Duplicate handler name validation is not working as expected, 4) Handler deletion protection for handlers with batches is not working correctly. The admin shed management features are working correctly with proper validation. The enhanced export system is working correctly with both JSON and PDF exports generated for each batch. The PDF files are properly formatted with all required sections and can be downloaded with the correct content types."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the farm management system frontend with all the latest features. The tabbed interface works correctly with all 6 tabs (Basic Info, Feed Phases, Additional Costs, Removals, Performance, Admin). The batch creation workflow is functional, allowing users to enter all required information across tabs and submit for calculation. The Admin tab allows adding handlers and sheds. The PDF export functionality works correctly, with download buttons appearing in the insights section. The cost breakdown visualization is clear and accurate, showing the distribution of costs with percentages. The net cost calculation properly accounts for bedding revenue. However, there are still issues with the handler performance endpoint (/api/handlers/performance) and handler names endpoint (/api/handlers/names) both returning 404 Not Found errors. The Performance tab does not display the handler performance ranking table due to these API issues."

    message: "Completed testing of the enhanced broiler chicken cost calculation backend with date handling and PDF generation features. Created a comprehensive test suite in enhanced_date_test.py that tests all the new features: batch creation with entry/exit dates, date validation, PDF generation with dates, data retrieval with dates, and viability calculations. All tests are now passing. The API correctly handles date formatting and parsing, calculates batch duration, includes dates in PDF reports, and properly calculates viability as the sum of removal batch quantities. The test with 10,000 chicks, entry date of 2024-01-15, exit date of 2024-03-01, and multiple removal batches works correctly. The PDF reports include entry/exit dates, viability information, and batch duration calculation as required."
